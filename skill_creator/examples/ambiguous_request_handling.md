# Example: Ambiguous Request Handling

**User Input**:
> "Make a skill for checking stuff."

**Reasoning**:
The request is too vague. I cannot generate a specific workflow without knowing *what* to check (URLs? Files? APIs?).

**Action/Output**:
> "Could you specify what kind of 'checking' this skill should perform? For example, is it for checking website uptime, validating code syntax, or verifying file permissions?"
